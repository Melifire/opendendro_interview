# opendendro_interview
The OpenDendro challenge portion of my UofA Student Software Engineer application

I used an anaconda virtual environment that was created and added-to by my editor (PyCharm).
It's imports include numpy and matplotlib and the yml file is included

The core of this program is the tree-ring-csv-opener.py file that, as its name suggests,
opens CSV files containing tree ring data. The program is called with the desired CSV file as a command line argument.

When run, a plot of the tree ring data is shown. For more information on the data, the terminal 
shows many statistics including the required first line from the CSV.

Thank you for your time!
